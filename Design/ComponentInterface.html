<h1> Purpose</h1>
<p>
	This document describes the means by which
	an application can affect the state
	of GUI components.
	This includes, for example,
	the way in which an application can enable or disable
	various components such as the "next generation" button.
	(Note: at this time
	only the <em>enabled</em>) property of components
	can be controlled.
	However there is no reason why
	this facility cannot be extended
	to other GUI component properties.)
</p>
<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>
	Each property that can be controlled 
	through this facility
	has a name declared in the GOLContants class.
	The name begins by declaring the component being controlled
	(e.g. <em>NEXT_GENERATION</em>)
	followed by the property being controlled
	(e.g. <em>ENABLED</em>)
	followed by either <em>PN</em>
	(for property-name)
	or <em>DV</em>
	(for default value).
</p>
<p>
	Examples:
</p>
<pre>	/** "Enabled" property of component to spawn next generation */
	public static final String NEXT_GENERATION_ENABLED_PN = "nextGenerationEnabled";
	/** "Enabled" property of next-generation feature default value */
	public static final String NEXT_GENERATION_ENABLED_DV = "true";</pre>
<p>
	Property name should avoid identifying component types
	since component types for a particular feature
	could change in the future, for example:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 3em;">
	FEATURE_ENABLED_PN, not 
	<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
		FEATURE_TOGGLE_BUTTON_ENABLED
	</span>.
</p>
<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>
	The ACProperties class will provide an initial value
	for each Component property
	according to the established hierarchy
	of sources for initial values 
	(command line, environment variable, property file, etc.).
	The ACProperties class is <em>not</em> responsible
	for maintaining the current value of a property,
	or for detecting the state of a GUI component
	with respect to that property.
</p>
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<p>
	The Parameters class is responsible
	for maintaining the current state
	of each property.
	Initial value of a property
	is obtained from the ACProperties class.
	The ACProperties class is <em>not</em> responsible
	for detecting the physical state of a property.
</p>
<p>
	The Parameters class
	will have <em>get</em> and <em>set</em> accessors
	for each property.
	Calls to the <em>set</em> accessor
	will generate a property-change event
	for the associated property.
	Application facilities can register
	for property-change notification
	by invoking one of the Parameters class's
	<em>addPropertyChangeListener</em> methods.
	<strong>
		Note that property changes are not vetoable.
	</strong>
</p>
<h1>GUI Components</h1>
<p>
	Guidelines for maintaining properties
	subject to control 
	via the Parameters class facilities:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Components should configure the state
		of such properties
		by interrogating the Parameters class
		at time of instantiation
		(i.e., the state of a property
		should not be hard-coded.)
	</li>
	<li>
		When a state change for a component
		precipitates changes to other components
		such changes should be affected
		via the Parameters class.
	</li>
	<li>
		Components should honor state changes
		generated via the Parameters class.
		It is the application programmer's responsibility
		to ensure that state changes
		are appropriate and consistent.
	</li>
</ul>
