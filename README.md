# CellAutamata
"Experiments with Cellular Automata and Fractals"
This project creates a framework for displaying various cellular autamata and fractals. It builds on the GameOfLife framework, which mainly
supported autamata in which cells could take on two states (such as the Game of Life and HighLife. This upgrade allows cells to have multiple
states, as required, for example, by totalistic cellular autamata algorithms.
